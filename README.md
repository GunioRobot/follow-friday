Our weekly picks for who to follow GitHub. Checkout the [The Changelog](http://thechangelog.com) for more details.

### #GFF 102910

#### [jamesgpearce (James Pearce)](http://github.com/jamesgpearce)

James' [modernizr-server](http://github.com/jamesgpearce/modernizr-server) brings Modernizr browser data to your server scripting environment. We've covered Modernizr being used in other projects before. Modernizr is a great way to find out about your user's browser capabilities. However, you can only access its API on the browser itself, which means you can't easily benefit from knowing about browser capabilities in your server logic. PHP is currently supported, and James intends to offer other server-side environments in the future, that's going to be based on demand!

### #GFF 092410

#### [bmizerany (Blake Mizerany)](http://github.com/bmizerany)

Blake's [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/) and its simple DSL have inspired more tribute bands than perhaps The Chairman himself. The next time you hear "it's like Sinatra, but for...", think of Blake. Blake has over a hundred repos on GitHub, his most recent is [Swirl](http://github.com/bmizerany/swirl), a version agnostic EC2 client.

#### [felixge (Felix Geisend√∂rfer)](http://github.com/felixge)

Outside of [Ryan Dahl](http://github.com/ry), perhaps nobody else as avidly contributed to Node.js than Felix. Felix also has created projects like [node-dirty](http://github.com/felixge/node-dirty), a tiny and fast key value store for Node that should be ideal for apps with < 1 million records.

#### [cloudhead (Alexis Sellier)](http://github.com/cloudhead)

Alexis has multi-language skills and is the mind behind [LessCSS](http://lesscss.org/) and [Vows](http://vowsjs.org/), but one of my favorite projects is [Toto](http://github.com/cloudhead/toto), a nifty Rack-based blogging tool for hackers.

#### [jashkenas (Jeremy Ashkenas)](http://github.com/jashkenas)

You probably know Jeremy's superhero alter-ego [Document Cloud](http://github.com/documentcloud) under which he's released popular projects like [Underscore.js](http://documentcloud.github.com/underscore/). But lately Jeremy's own project [CoffeeScript](http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/) has also become quite popular. Jeremy is the first two-time guest on The Changelog, appearing [Episode 0.0.5](http://thechangelog.com/post/272530971/episode-0-0-5-document-cloud) and [Episode 0.2.9](http://thechangelog.com/post/849754840/episode-0-2-9-coffeescript-with-jeremy-ashkenas).
